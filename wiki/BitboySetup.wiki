#summary Setting up the Bitboy application.
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

This manual will guide you through the process of setting up the Bitboy application. In this example we will use FlexBuilder 3 but theoretically all of our projects can be compiled using the command line.

== Requirements ==

We assume you went through the LibrarySetup and have the following already set up:

  * A working PopforgeLibrary project
  * Subversive and the Popforge repositoy (you created it while setting up the library)

= Creating the Bitboy project =

  * Go to `File` > `New` and select `ActionScript Project`
  * Name the project "Bitboy"
  * Click Next
  * Enter "src" as the `Main source folder`
  * Enter "Main.as" as the `Main application file`
  * Switch to the `Library path` tab
  * Click `Add Project...`
  * Select "PopforgeLibrary" and click `Ok`
  * Click `Finish`

#summary A solution to easy graphical user interface creation.

=SmartGUI=

To bring more fun in developing synthesizer, effect devices and stuff it would be nice to have a powerful tool that helps creating a graphical user interface within a few clicks. As you know GUI programming is a pain in the ass and takes often much more time then the actual application logic.

==Idea==

We will create a grid based UI editor with certain UI elements (listed below) plus a simple framework to connect the custom UI with the parameters (`de.popforge.parameter`) of your objects (synth, effect, ...). Each element can only occupy a certain rectangular area in the tilemap. Overlapping is not allowed.

Imagine:
{{{
gui= new SmartGUI();
gui.loadLayout( 'mysynth.xml' );
gui.connect( 'volume/attack', synth.parameterVolumeAttack );
[...]
addChild( gui );
//-> ready
}}}

= Elements =

We only think in terms of devices, so there is no need for input fields or flying windows. This makes it a lot of easier to keep it clean and simple.

  * Input Elements
    # Trigger Button
    # SwitchButton (MappingBoolean)
    # RadioGroup (MappingValues)
    # Slider (MappingBoolean,MappingNumber,MappingValues) [horizontal/vertical]
    # Knobs (Mapping as Sliders)
  * Output Elements
    # Label
    # Digit Display
    # Oscilloscope
